This small project is basically the collection of different python programs, which I wrote or I converted from IDL. Some of the routines copy the functionality of astrolib routines or other IDL plotting/fitting(e.g. MPFIT) routines, some others I wrote from scratch.
The initial goal of the project was to make it easier to go from IDL to Python by having interfaces closely resembling IDL ones. Now I just commit here whatever small library-type programs I write. I understand that the name "astrolibpy" may be to ambitious for the project, but too late to change it anyway.

Python version of the MPFIT library can be retrieved from the Downloads section, all other programs can be retrieved from the subversion repository http://code.google.com/p/astrolibpy/source/browse/#svn/trunk

The short description of what is in astrolibpy is given in the [wiki](http://code.google.com/p/astrolibpy/wiki/AstrolibpyContents)
